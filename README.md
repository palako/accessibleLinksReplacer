# Accessible Links Replacer
A Chrome extension that uses OpenAI to replace links with a more accessible version.

This is just a proof of concept to highlight the simplicity of the task thanks to the power of LLMs.

There is no error handling, and it only supports replacing the word 'link'. 

Hopefully it makes the point clear enough so that if someone wanted to do something useful with it, it could be expanded, or ported to other browsers.

If you want to give it a try, go to chrome://extensions/ and use the "Load Unpacked" button.
There is an "Options" choice in the contextual menu of the extension's icon where you can enter your OpenAI key.
